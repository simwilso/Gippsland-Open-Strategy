# Voting Process

Vote with üëç on Issues to show support and help prioritize.

A PR is approved when:
- Maintainer reviews and approves

Community votes help guide decisions but maintainer approval is required.

## How Voting Works

1. **Find an Issue**: Browse the [Issues](../../issues) tab to find proposals you're interested in
2. **Vote**: Click the üëç emoji reaction on issues you support
3. **Community Input**: Votes are tracked and displayed as labels (e.g., "votes:5")
4. **Maintainer Review**: Maintainers review popular issues and approve PRs for implementation
