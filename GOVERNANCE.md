# Governance Model

Maintainers manage approvals.

Community votes guide direction.

## Overview

This project follows a hybrid governance model that balances maintainer oversight with community-driven decision making. We believe the best ideas can come from anywhere, and our governance structure reflects this philosophy.

## Decision Making Process

### 1. Community Proposals
- Anyone can submit ideas via GitHub Issues
- All proposals are visible and open for discussion
- Community members vote using üëç reactions

### 2. Approval Pathway

**Maintainer Approval Required**
- All PRs require explicit maintainer approval before processing
- Community votes inform and guide maintainer decisions
- High vote counts signal community priority but don't automatically trigger changes
- Maintainers consider community input while maintaining quality and security standards

### 3. Implementation
- Approved proposals are processed by automated systems
- Pull requests are created and reviewed
- Changes are merged following quality checks

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Community Members
- Submit proposals and ideas
- Vote on issues that matter to them
- Participate in discussions
- Test and provide feedback on changes

### Maintainers
- Review proposals for technical feasibility
- Fast-track urgent or critical changes
- Ensure code quality and project standards
- Mentor new contributors
- Manage repository settings and access

### Automated Systems
- Monitor voting thresholds
- Create pull requests for approved issues
- Run tests and quality checks
- Update documentation
- Notify stakeholders of changes
