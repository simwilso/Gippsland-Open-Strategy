# Making the Gippsland Open Strategy Operational

## Overview

Since Claude-Flow runs on top of Claude Code and requires your local Claude Code installation, the workflow is designed to work in a semi-automated way. Here's how to make it operational:

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup with community workflow"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repo Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `gh-pages` (will be created by the publish workflow)
4. Save

### 3. Install Dependencies Locally
```bash
# Install Docusaurus dependencies
cd site
npm install
cd ..

# Install intake system dependencies
cd flows/intake
npm install
cd ../..
```

### 4. The Operational Workflow

Since Claude-Flow requires your Claude Code subscription and runs locally, here's the actual workflow:

#### A. Community Submission Phase (Fully Automated)
1. ‚úÖ Community submits suggestions via GitHub Issues
2. ‚úÖ Community votes with üëç reactions
3. ‚úÖ Vote counts are automatically tracked as labels
4. ‚úÖ You review popular issues

#### B. Processing Phase (Semi-Automated)
When you approve a PR:

1. **GitHub Side** (Automated):
   - ‚úÖ PR gets 'ready-for-swarm' label
   - ‚úÖ Workflow creates a notification/placeholder

2. **Your Local Side** (Manual but Claude-Flow assisted):
   ```bash
   # Pull the PR locally
   git fetch origin pull/[PR-NUMBER]/head:pr-[PR-NUMBER]
   git checkout pr-[PR-NUMBER]
   
   # Run Claude-Flow to process the changes
   npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run task-orchestrator "Review and implement the changes from this PR"
   
   # The swarm will analyze the PR and create the documentation updates
   # Push the results
   git add .
   git commit -m "Swarm implementation of PR #[PR-NUMBER]"
   git push origin pr-[PR-NUMBER]
   ```

3. **Merge and Deploy** (Automated):
   - ‚úÖ Merge the PR
   - ‚úÖ GitHub Actions publishes to GitHub Pages

## üîß Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Runner (Self-Hosted)
You could set up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on your machine with Claude Code:
- Pros: Fully automated
- Cons: Requires your machine to be always on

### Option 2: Webhook Integration
Set up a webhook to notify you when PRs need processing:
- Use a service like IFTTT or Zapier
- Get notifications when 'ready-for-swarm' label is added
- Process locally and push results

### Option 3: Scheduled Processing
Set up a daily/weekly routine:
```bash
# Create a local script: process-approved-prs.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script checks for approved PRs and processes them with Claude-Flow
```

## üìù Testing the Workflow

1. **Create a Test Issue**:
   - Go to Issues ‚Üí New Issue ‚Üí "Suggest an improvement"
   - Fill out the form
   - Submit

2. **Add Votes**:
   - Have 2-3 people add üëç reactions
   - Watch the vote label update

3. **Create a PR**:
   - Create a PR based on the issue
   - Approve it as maintainer
   - See the 'ready-for-swarm' label appear

4. **Process with Claude-Flow**:
   - Run the local processing steps above
   - Push results
   - Merge and watch it deploy

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review highly-voted issues weekly
- Process approved PRs with Claude-Flow
- Monitor GitHub Pages deployment
- Update swarm templates as needed

### Monitoring
- Check Actions tab for workflow runs
- Review Pages deployments
- Monitor issue vote counts
- Track PR processing time

## ü§ù Community Communication

Let your community know:
1. How to submit suggestions (link to issue template)
2. How voting works (link to VOTING.md)
3. Expected processing time (e.g., "PRs processed weekly")
4. Where to see published changes (GitHub Pages URL)
