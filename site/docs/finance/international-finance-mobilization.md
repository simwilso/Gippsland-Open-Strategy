By creating a diversified funding structure with natural currency hedges, robust risk mitigation, and clear development impact, we unlock the international capital required to transform Gippsland into a global renewable energy hub.

The combination of strong government support, $125B contracted export revenues, and alignment with global climate mandates creates an unprecedented investment opportunity that delivers both financial returns and transformational development impact. With immediate action on MDB engagement, ECA partnerships, and green bond issuance, we can secure $20B in committed funding by end-2025, providing the foundation for full program deployment.
