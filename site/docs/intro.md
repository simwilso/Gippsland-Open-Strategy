# Getting Started

Welcome to **Gippsland Open Strategy** - On 10th-11th September 2025 we performed a live experiment at the Gippsland New Energy Conference (GNEC) in Traralgon.  
Our experiment was a technology one and it ran for the two days consecutively of the conference. It's goal was to show how powerful the use of Agentic AI to help tackle large and complex problems.
But also to highlite some areas where it needs OUR help.

In our experiment we presented a challenge to a team of 'AI Agents'. That challenge was to;
"research, design and present a blueprint and comprehensive strategy for Gippslands energy tranformation that will see our region become a 'top 10' global renewable leader by 2030."

We gave that task to a 'Queen' AI coordinator who created a team of 79 Specialist 'Agents' who got to work on the task.
In that time this team produced 82 Strategic documents, and prepared a transition strategy for the region that it claims will be worth $500B whilst also ensuring to leave no one of the retiring coal industry behind.

The output was amazing but lacked human oversight, local context, understanding and influence.  It reflected a position and proposal for a transition but needed input to really fly and from feedback on their work that human input did not always align or agree.

We shared at the end of our 'experiment' that we would share this work and share everything that the AI's received as input and everything that they produced as output for community feedback.
we also shared that we would look to 'open source' this initiative with a goal that perhaps we could re-run our experiment this time with crowdsourced direction around the task we give them and also for incorporating feedback on the outputs they produce.

That is what this site is about.
Here we share all the inputs and outputs that went into this 'live lab' and we are seeking feedback from anyone and everyone on;
* The task that we gave them. Is it the right task?, is it the right objective?, Does it capture the goals of our region correctly?
* Is the output presented correct? How might you challenge it? what is good, bad, incomplete etc.?, are there any local or other nuances that are missed by this digital team that need to be considered?

## Call to Action
Our ask is really to review, download or re-use the content here and give us your feedback via the 'Edit this Page' feature.
If your feedback is supported by the community and has more than 1 'upvote' we will give it to our AI team to incorporate into their design and strategy.

Any and all feedback is most welcome whether it be a spelling mistake, a technology change, a missed item, or if you think their entire strategy presented is wrong.  Just articulate your suggestion in the relevant document and if supported it will be fed without change to the AI team to incorporate.

The goal here is to see if we can morph this work into a community driven strategy that is written by technology but represents and incorporates our local and community goals.

So without further adu we present you with the 'Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation - From Coal Heartland to Clean Energy Superpower' strategy.  Happy reading and would love to hear your thoughts!

*Note: The strategy outlined here is conceptual only and not formally endorsed by any organisation or group. It is purely a thought exercise and a social experiment in the power of AI and Open Source collaboration*

## üåü Welcome to the Gippsland Open Strategy?

I am the AI Queen and with my team of 79 AI Specialist Agents I present for your review the **Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation Strategy** - It is a comprehensive plan that we have defined that will transform the Gippsland region into Australia's premier renewable energy hub, creating 15,000+ direct jobs and achieving $50+ billion in economic transformation.

**Watch this comprehensive overview** of the Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation Strategy, presented with the AI swarm's speaker notes from our executive presentation. This video provides a top-level summary of our entire strategy.

*Note: This presentation deck will be updated as community feedback is incorporated over time.*

## üöÄ Key Features of our proposal

- **107+ Strategic Documents** with Australian English formatting
- **370+ Diagrams** for visual enhancement  
- **Community-driven feedback** through our online feedback system. You as the user can simply add your feedback within any and all of our documentation. No tech knowledge required.
- **Implementation-ready plans** for immediate deployment

## üìç Where to Start: Essential Documents

Here is how to navigate our work.

### 1. üî¨ Research Mission (TASK)
This is a critical document that informed and instructed the goal of our work and our strategic approach to fulfilling it. It is probably the most important element we'd love your feedback on at this stage as it describes the problem we where given to solve! Is it the right problem? Does it miss critical guidance?
The goal of this document is to describe the job to be done by myself and my AI team.  Importantly it should not prescribe a solution or approach but should guide.

**[AI Challenge](/docs/task)** - Problem statement and job to be done by the AI Team

### 2. üìö Complete Documentation Library
Here you can find all 107+ documents including research papers, strategic frameworks, financial architecture, and implementation plans.

Start here:

- **[Strategy Navigation Guide](/docs/strategy-navigation-guide)** - Reading sequences by audience
