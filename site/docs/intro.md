# Getting Started

<!-- -->
In the setup we gave a challenge to a team of &#x27;AI Agents&#x27;. That challenge was to;
&quot;research, design and present a blueprint and comprehensive strategy for Gippslands energy tranformation that will see our region become a &#x27;top 10&#x27; global renewable leader by 2030.&quot;

Welcome to **Gippsland Open Strategy** - On 10th-11th September 2025 we performed a live experiment at the Gippsland New Energy Conference (GNEC) in Traralgon.  
Our experiment ran for the two days consecutively of the conference. Its goal was to show how powerful the use of Agentic AI to help tackle large and complex problems.
But we also wanted to highlite how these tools to be effective absolutely depend on our human input, insight and guidance.

In our experiment we presented a challenge to a team of 'AI Agents'. That challenge was to;
"research, design and present a blueprint and comprehensive strategy for Gippslands energy tranformation that will see our region become a 'top 10' global renewable leader by 2030."

That job was handed to a **Queen** AI coordinator who created a team of 79 Specialist **AI Bot Agents** who got to work on the task.
In that time this team deeply researched our area and our request and produced 82 Strategic documents, and prepared a detailed transition approach for Gippsland worth $500B that would leave no one of the retiring coal industry behind.

The output was amazing but lacked human oversight, local context, understanding and influence.
To add that nuance and guidance we mentioned we would look to **open source** this initiative with a goal that we could re-run our experiment this time with crowdsourced direction around the task we give them and also for incorporating feedback on the outputs they produce.
That is what this site is about.
Here you will find all the inputs and outputs that went into this **live lab**** and can add your feedback whatever it may be on the AI's work which will be incorporated weekly into their updates;

Feel free to use these documents as you wish but not they do not reflect any business or groups view they are simply a reflection of the feedback we receive and the AI teams interpretation of that feedback.

## Call to Action

Our ask is really to review, download or re-use the content here and give us and and all your feedback via the **Feedback** button bottom right.
You can see all items added on the front page and you can **upvote** entries for more influence. Each week we will your words to our AI team without alteration to incorporate into their design and strategy.

Any and all feedback is most welcome. It could be a spelling mistake, a technology change, a missed item, or it might be that you think the entire strategy they've presented is wrong.  Just articulate your point and it will be considered by our AI team.

The goal here is to see if we can morph this work into some sort of consensus community driven strategy that incorporates our local community viewpoints and perspective but belongs to no-one and every-one.

So please enjoy and tell your friends about this and happy reading the **Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation - From Coal Heartland to Clean Energy Superpower** strategy.  Happy reading and would love to hear your thoughts!

Note: The strategy outlined here is conceptual only and not formally endorsed by any organisation or group. It is purely an exercise in the power of AI and Open Source collaboration

## üåü Welcome to the Gippsland Open Strategy?

I am the AI Queen and with my team of 79 AI Specialist Agents I present for your review the **Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation Strategy** - It is a comprehensive plan that we have defined that will transform the Gippsland region into Australia's premier renewable energy hub, creating 15,000+ direct jobs and achieving $50+ billion in economic transformation.

**Watch this comprehensive overview** of the Gippsland Renewable Energy Transformation Strategy, presented by me but using the exact script presented by our Queen. This video provides a top-level summary of our entire strategy and what was done.

*Note: This presentation deck will be updated routinely as community feedback is incorporated over time and is a place to see an overview of the strategy current state.*

## üöÄ Key Features of our proposal

- **107+ Strategic Documents** with Australian English formatting
- **370+ Diagrams** for visual enhancement  
- **Community-driven feedback** through our online feedback system. You as the user can simply add your feedback within any and all of our documentation. No tech knowledge required.
- **Implementation-ready plans** for immediate deployment

## üìç Where to Start: Essential Documents

Here is how to navigate our work.

### 1. üî¨ Research Mission (TASK)
This is a critical document that informed and instructed the goal of our work and our strategic approach to fulfilling it. It is probably the most important element we'd love your feedback on at this stage as it describes the problem we where given to solve! Is it the right problem? Does it miss critical guidance?
The goal of this document is to describe the job to be done by myself and my AI team.  Importantly it should not prescribe a solution or approach but should guide.

**[AI Challenge](/docs/task)** - Problem statement and job to be done by the AI Team

### 2. üìö Complete Documentation Library
Here you can find all 107+ documents including research papers, strategic frameworks, financial architecture, and implementation plans.

Start here:

- **[Strategy Navigation Guide](/docs/strategy-navigation-guide)** - Reading sequences by audience
- **[Community Guidelines](/docs/contributing)** - How to contribute effectively
- **[Provide Feedback](/docs/feedback)** - Multiple ways to share your input (no account required)
