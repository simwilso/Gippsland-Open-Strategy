## Conclusion: Embedding Community Voice in Every Action

This Community Engagement Operations framework ensures that Gippsland's remarkable 79% community support is not just maintained but strengthened through every phase of the renewable energy transformation. By embedding community voice in every decision, respecting Indigenous sovereignty and partnership, and creating systems that genuinely respond to community needs, we build not just infrastructure but enduring community prosperity.

The success of these operations will be measured not just in gigawatts of renewable energy delivered, but in the continued trust, participation, and enthusiasm of every Gippsland community. Through professional excellence, cultural respect, and genuine partnership, we ensure that this transformation truly belongs to the people of Gippsland.
