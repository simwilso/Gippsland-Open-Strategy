**Script:**
"Our methodology rested on four critical pillars. First, deep local analysis - we mapped every asset, every stakeholder, every community need. We know exactly who needs what support and when.

Second, global benchmarking - we studied the world's top renewable hubs from Denmark's offshore wind leadership to Scotland's just transition success. We extracted every lesson, every best practice, every mistake to avoid.

Third, cutting-edge technology assessment - from 15-megawatt offshore turbines to green hydrogen at $2.50 per kilogramme. We've identified technologies that will give Gippsland first-mover advantage.

Fourth, rigorous data validation - every number, every projection, every recommendation has been fact-checked and stress-tested. When we say $150 billion opportunity, we can defend every dollar.

This methodology enabled us to execute a comprehensive six-phase research programme that covers every aspect of transformation."

### 💡 Key Delivery Notes

    Political Will
      Bipartisan commitment
      20-year horizon
      Beyond elections
    Infrastructure
      $8-10B grid investment
      Fast-track approvals
      Transmission priority
    Community
      Genuine co-design

```

**Script:**
"Success depends on five critical factors. First, bipartisan political commitment with a 20-year horizon. Energy transformation transcends electoral cycles - we need sustained support regardless of who's in government.

Second, grid infrastructure fast-tracking with $8-10 billion investment. Transmission bottlenecks are the biggest risk to our timeline - we must act urgently.

Third, genuine community co-design. Not consultation - partnership. Communities must shape this transformation, not just receive it.

Fourth, workforce development ahead of deployment. Start training before projects begin, not after they're announced.

Fifth, international technology partnerships with global leaders who can accelerate our learning curve.

Remember - we have 18 months to secure first-mover advantage. Global competition is intensifying. Act decisively now, or watch opportunities migrate to other regions.

The good news is we're ready to launch."
