# Technology Documentation Enhancement Summary

## Overview
All technology documentation has been enhanced with Australian English conventions, technical diagrams, tables, and visual representations to make complex technical content more accessible and professional.

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. Australian English Conventions
- **Spelling Updates:**
  - optimization → optimisation
  - maximize → maximisation
  - commercialization → commercialisation
  - electrolyzer → electrolyser
  - meters → metres
  - aluminum → aluminium
  - prioritization → prioritisation

### 2. Visual Enhancements Added

#### Mermaid Diagrams
- **Technology Portfolio Overview:** Visual hierarchy of 45 first-of-kind projects
- **System Architecture Diagrams:** Digital twin layers, grid architecture, hydrogen value chain
- **Timeline Visualizations:** Gantt charts for project roadmaps
- **Process Flow Diagrams:** Technology validation pathways
- **Network Diagrams:** IP filing strategies, research collaboration networks

#### Technical Tables
- **Technology Specifications:** Converted text blocks to structured tables
- **Performance Metrics:** Clear tabular format with status indicators
- **Investment Breakdowns:** Financial data in accessible table format
- **Comparison Matrices:** Technology options side-by-side

#### Data Visualizations
- **Pie Charts:** Investment distribution, technology portfolios
- **Radar Charts:** Multi-dimensional technology comparisons
- **Bar Charts:** Capacity distributions, timeline progressions
