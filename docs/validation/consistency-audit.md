## 1. Strategic Consistency Analysis

### 1.1 Vision Alignment Assessment

**Primary Vision Statement (Master Blueprint v2.0)**
> "By 2030, Gippsland will be recognized as a top-10 global renewable energy hub, demonstrating that rapid decarbonization can drive unprecedented economic prosperity, technological innovation, and community wellbeing while ensuring no worker or community is left behind."

**Consistency Check Results:**
- ✅ All 23 strategy documents use consistent vision language
- ✅ "Top-10 global hub by 2030" appears uniformly
- ✅ "No worker or community left behind" theme consistent
- ✅ Economic prosperity + decarbonization dual focus maintained

**Minor Variations Found:**
- Older blueprint (v1.0) referenced 2040 timeline - needs update
- Some documents add regional qualifiers but maintain core message
