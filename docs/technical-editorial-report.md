3. **Currency**: Ensure data is current (within 2 years for rapidly evolving technologies)
4. **Regional Relevance**: Confirm applicability to Australian/Gippsland conditions
5. **Peer Review**: Have technical sections reviewed by subject matter experts

### 4.2 Common Technical Errors to Avoid

**Power vs Energy Confusion**
- ❌ "500 MW battery" 
- ✓ "500 MW / 2,000 MWh battery"

**Efficiency Specifications**
- ❌ "90% efficient"
- ✓ "90% round-trip efficiency"

**Cost Comparisons**
- ❌ "$100/kW for storage"
- ✓ "$100/kWh for 4-hour storage" or "$400/kW for 4-hour storage"

**Capacity Factor Assumptions**
- ❌ "Wind generates 2 GW"
- ✓ "2 GW wind capacity with 40% capacity factor yields ~800 MW average"

### 4.3 Technical Calculation Standards

**Energy Calculations:**
```
Annual Energy (MWh) = Capacity (MW) × 8,760 hours × Capacity Factor
Example: 100 MW solar at 25% CF = 100 × 8,760 × 0.25 = 219,000 MWh/year
```

**Storage Duration:**
```
Duration (hours) = Energy Capacity (MWh) ÷ Power Capacity (MW)
Example: 400 MWh ÷ 100 MW = 4-hour storage system
```

**Hydrogen Production:**
```
Electrolyzer efficiency: 70% (4.5 kWh/Nm³ or 50 kWh/kg H₂)
Annual production = Capacity (MW) × 8,760 × CF × Efficiency ÷ 50
Example: 100 MW at 80% CF = 11,200 tonnes H₂/year
```
