## üíé CONCLUSION

This Community Wealth Creation Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring Gippsland's renewable energy transition creates lasting local prosperity. By emphasising community ownership, local business development, Indigenous participation, and intergenerational wealth building, we can transform temporary project investments into permanent community assets.

### üéØ Success Vision 2035

- **20,000 community investors** owning significant stakes in renewable assets
- **$5 billion annual economic activity** circulating locally
- **30,000 jobs** created directly and indirectly
- **1,000 new businesses** serving the renewable energy sector
- **$1 billion endowment fund** securing future prosperity
- **100% renewable energy** powering the region

### üöÄ Call to Action

The strategy's success depends on strong partnerships between communities, Traditional Owners, governments, and private developers. With proper implementation, Gippsland can become a global model for how renewable energy can drive equitable economic development and create prosperity that lasts for generations.

**Together, we power prosperity.**
