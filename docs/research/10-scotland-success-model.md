# Scotland's Renewable Energy Success Model: Community Power and Just Transition Lessons for Gippsland

## Executive Summary

Scotland has achieved a remarkable transformation in renewable energy, generating 113% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2022 and continuing to break records in 2024. This success is built on three pillars: aggressive policy targets, community energy ownership, and a comprehensive Just Transition approach that prioritizes workers and communities. The Orkney Islands exemplify this model, generating over 100% renewable electricity since 2013 despite significant grid constraints, using innovative solutions like hydrogen production and strong community participation. For Gippsland, Scotland offers a proven blueprint for transitioning from fossil fuels while ensuring local prosperity and social equity.
