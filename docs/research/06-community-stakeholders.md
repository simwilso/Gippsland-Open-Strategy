## 4. Community Voices and Stories

### Success Stories

Now I'm working on the Bald Hills wind farm, earning more than before, and my kids are proud of Dad working in clean energy. The union fought hard for us to get quality training, not just tick-box courses."* 
- Jim Thompson, Former coal worker, now wind technician

#### "Community Power Works" - Sarah's Experience  
*"Our community energy group started small - just neighbors wanting cheaper power. Now we're developing a 5MW solar farm that will power 1,500 homes and return profits to community projects. The Hepburn Wind model showed us it was possible. Local council support was crucial."*
- Sarah Chen, Mirboo North Community Energy

#### "Protecting Country While Progress" - Uncle Russell
*"GLaWAC's involvement from day one meant the offshore wind developers understood our connection to Sea Country. We've mapped cultural sites, created protection zones, and secured Indigenous employment targets. This shows development can happen with proper respect."*
- Uncle Russell Mullett, GLaWAC Elder

### Concerns and Challenges

#### "Rushed and Ignored" - Mary's Frustration
*"They announced transmission lines through our property with no consultation. Three generations of farming, and they want to put 80-meter towers through our best paddocks. We're not anti-renewable, but this top-down approach creates opposition."*
- Mary Patterson, Affected landholder

#### "Where Are Our Jobs?" - Tony's Skepticism
*"Every project promises local jobs, but then contractors bring workers from Melbourne. My electrical business could do the work, but we can't compete with established players. We need real local content enforcement."*
- Tony Kowalski, Traralgon electrical contractor

#### "Tourism at Risk" - Beach Community Concerns
*"Offshore wind farms will destroy our pristine coastal views that tourists come for. Property values will crash. Why should we sacrifice our lifestyle for city people's power? No one asked us."*
- Beachside Residents Association submission
